# earthAPI test

Welcome to earthAPI!

This is an exercise to develop backend with geospatial data using python.

The data used for this exercise is an image from ESA's Sentinel 2 satellite `S2L2A_2022-06-09.tiff`.

To be able to use this program you can run:

```
make build
```

This will create the virtual environment and install the required packages.

Then finally:

```
make run
```

will run the application with `uvicorn`.
